        <h2>Acupuncture</h2>
        <p>As human beings, we are unique bioenergetic systems - and part of a vital life force that flows through all things. In Oriental Medicine, this is called Qi ("chee"); in the West, we call it energy. Your energy (Qi) flows along pathways in your body that are related to your organs and tendo-muscular system.</p>
        <p>When the balance of your energy is disturbed, you can experience pain or illness. It may be due to trauma, poor diet, medications, stress, hereditary conditions, environmental factors, or emotional issues.</p>
        <p>Oriental Medicine focuses on correcting these energetic imbalances by breaking up obstructions and encouraging an even flow of Qi, which stimulates your body's natural ability to heal itself.</p>
        <p>Acupuncture involves the strategic placement of tiny needles into a pattern that spans your body, from head to toe. We use these painless needles to stimulate specific energy points. During your session, we may also use techniques such as moxabustion (heat), gua sha (scraping), cupping (suction), auricular therapy (ear acupuncture), electrical or laser stimulation, or even manual stimulation of the points.</p>
        <p>Acupuncture has been proven as an effective treatment for hundreds of acute and chronic ailments. It can help relieve pain, enhance your body's recuperative powers, and strengthen your immune system.  Some specific areas of treatment at Branch Acupuncture include:</p>

            <p class="lead">Helping with weight loss.</p>
            <p>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the root of excess weight is an imbalance in the body caused by the malfunctioning of your spleen and liver.</p>
            <p>The spleen is responsible for your digestive system's function - and disharmony may result in fatigue, slow metabolism, water retention, loose stool, and feeling of heaviness. The liver keeps your body's Qi, blood, and emotions flowing. When it's not working properly, it can affect your spleen, digestive system, and metabolism. It also may cause some of the "triggers" that lead to cravings and compulsive eating.</p>
            <p>Using acupuncture points, foods, and herbs, we can help you with weight loss by treating the root causes. Our approach can enhance the function of your nervous system, endocrine system, digestive system, and metabolism. It will energize your body and help to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce your cravings</li>
              <li>Control overeating</li>
              <li>Suppress your appetite</li>
              <li>Reduce anxiety</li>
              <li>Maximize the absorption of nutrients</li>
              <li>Regulate elimination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each treatment is designed for your individual needs. We recommend scheduling sessions approximately twice a week for 12 weeks or until you reach your goal. <span class="copy-required">(MOLLY - I need details here - I'm making this up!)</span></p>

            <p class="lead">Reducing your stress.</p>
            <p>We all have stress - sometimes it's good (weddings, new babies); sometimes it's bad (family arguments, tight deadlines). Stress causes an imbalance in your body's energy; your Qi can become blocked and stagnant, flowing improperly. You may experience physical symptoms such as high blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, stiff neck and shoulders, headaches, back problems, muscle aches, etc.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture can unblock your Qi and restore harmonious balance to your body. We'll stimulate your body's natural healing processes, alleviating your stress-induced symptoms. By improving the circulation of your blood (and your Qi), you'll feel calm and relaxed, and you'll be better able to cope with stress.</p>

If you're affected by cancer, acupuncture can help you control pain, manage the side effects of treatments like chemotherapy (e.g., nausea and vomiting), and ultimately, enhance your recovery.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture is believed to cause physical responses in nerve cells, your pituitary gland, and parts of your brain. These responses can cause your body to release proteins, hormones, and brain chemicals that control a number of bodily functions. It can affect blood pressure and body temperature, boost immune system activity, and cause your natural painkillers (endorphins) to be released.</p>

            <p>We place needles at specific energy points linked to your reproductive organs. This increases and moves the flow of your Qi from areas where it may be too abundant to areas that are deficient - completely focused on encouraging better fertility.</p>

            <p class="lead">Natural pain management.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture has been used to manage both chronic and acute pain for centuries. Because we treat your body as a whole, we can often reduce pain immediately and help you avoid future pain in the same areas.</p>
            <p>This powerful natural treatment stimulates energy points on your body that release endorphins and other natural pain relievers. Research shows acupuncture also increases the electromagnetic signals among the different cells in your body, which can also encourage healing and eliminate pain.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture increases blood circulation to different parts of your body while relaxing your muscles. It helps promote your emotional well-being and can boost your immune system. Best of all, instead of potentially compromising your health to reduce pain (like using conventional medications), acupuncture elevates the health of your whole body!</p>
            <p>Over the years, acupuncture has been used to successfully treat many painful conditions, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arthritis</li>
              <li>Back pain</li>

            <p>Do you want to improve muscle tone and dermal contraction in your face and neck? Facial rejuvenation acupuncture increases collagen production and helps disperse it - which firms your skin and fills out wrinkles. You'll also see bags and sagging around your eyes, face, and neck significantly reduced and toned. These treatments even improve your metabolism, which helps reduce - and in some cases, eliminate - puffiness.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture can help regulate your body's hormones, improving conditions such as acne or overly dry skin. By substantially increasing the circulation of blood, lymph, and Qi to the head, these treatments noticeably improve your complexion. It can help restore healthy facial coloring and tighten your pores.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>

          <p>Branch Acupuncture started in a one-room office in Rochester. We soon expanded to a Brighton location, and most recently, we've relocated to a beautiful, historic chapel in the Bushnell's Basin area. Our new location has been completely renovated to accommodate our practice</p>
          <p class="text-center"><img src="img/office.jpg"></p>
          <p>Clients find the new space relaxing, peaceful, and convenient - of course, there's free parking.</p>

          <p>Branch Acupuncture is run by Molly Branch. Molly was born and grew up in the Rochester area. She holds a B.A. from St. Bonaventure University and a Master of Professional Studies in Community Services Administration from Alfred University. She worked in healthcare administration before pursuing her career as an acupuncturist.</p>
          <p class="text-center"><img src="img/molly.jpg"></p>
          <p>Molly received her second graduate degree, a Masters of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine, from the New England School of Acupuncture in Boston, Massachusetts. The four-year program included a clinical practice and a core curriculum in Western sciences and biomedicine. This background helps Molly to assess each patient's medical needs before beginning treatment.</p>
          <p>Molly is licensed as an Acupuncturist by the New York State Educational Department, Office of the Professions. She is also licensed in Massachusetts and Vermont. She is certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) with a Diploma in Acupuncture. </p>

          <h3 class="faq-title">What a treatment is like?</h3>

          <p class="copy-required">(NOTE: I suggest changing your email on the site to something like Molly@mollybranch.com or info@mollybranch.com - the Yahoo domain and "dragon" moniker sound too personal, IMHO)</p>

          <h3>Office Hours</h3>
          <p class="copy-required">(I'm thinking you don't want to post actual hours, but if you do, that would be good - I just know people will want that info on this page, so I thought I'd add it.)</p>
